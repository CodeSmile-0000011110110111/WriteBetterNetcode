### About the Project on GitHub  
The GitHub version of the project is shared under the **GPL3 license** which prohibits publishing on digital stores. This GPL3 license does of course NOT apply to Asset Store customers! The **Standard Unity Asset Store EULA** overrides it.

Thus, as a paying customer, you are eligible to get the latest project updates directly from its GitHub repository! You may even want to fork and clone it to make it easier to integrate changes into your project.

### Contact Me!

For support, I'd appreciate it if you'd create a public topic in [Unity Discussions](https://discussions.unity.com/). Be sure to include **@CodeSmile** in the text so I get sent an email notification. 

Using Discussions for MultiPal support greatly helps with my asset's visibility! 

I'm on Discussions daily anyway, but I'm not keen on Discord since it's an extremely distracting productivity killer, just like any other directed communication tool (eg Phones, even long before they were falsely classified as 'smart').

Use my email below for business inquiries.
