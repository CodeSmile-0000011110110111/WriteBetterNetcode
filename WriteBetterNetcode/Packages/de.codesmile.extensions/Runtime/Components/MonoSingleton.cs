	/// <summary>
	///     Slim and safe MonoBehaviour Singleton with guaranteed lifetime from first instantiation to application quit.
	///     Safeguarded against instance duplication, instance re-assignment and premature destruction.
	/// </summary>
	/// <example>
	///     Create a singleton instance by subclassing:
	///     `public class MySingleton : MonoSingleton&lt;MySingleton&gt; {}`
	/// </example>
	/// <remarks>
	///     This singleton can be used in two ways:
	///     1) Classic: add singleton component to a GameObject in prefab or scene. Then override Awake and either call
	///     base.Awake() or SetSingletonInstance(this).
	///     2) Auto-Create: do NOT add the singleton component to a GameObject! The first time T.Singleton is accessed, a new
	///     GameObject with the T component gets created automatically.
	///     NOTE: in BOTH cases the singleton's GameObject gets marked as DontDestroyOnLoad(instance) to guarantee it persists
	///     throughout scene changes. Keep this in mind when adding additional components to the same GameObject (prefer not
	///     to do so).
	/// </remarks>
	/// <remarks>
	///     Classic (1) singleton is required if you need to assign singleton fields in the Inspector. You have to ensure that
	///     the GameObject has its base.Awake() method called before any script accesses its Singleton field, otherwise you get
	///     an "already instantiated" exception.
	///     Auto-Create (2) singleton is recommended otherwise. This guarantees that the Singleton is available as soon as its
	///     being accessed the first time. There is no need to test for 'if (T.Singleton != null)' anywhere for Auto-Create
	///     singletons.
	/// </remarks>
	/// <remarks>
	///     This singleton is not re-entrant on purpose. You cannot, and must not, destroy the singleton component or the
	///     GameObject it is added to once it has been created. That is the definition of a singleton. If you need to perform
	///     cleanup, do so by hooking into appropriate event methods such as scene load or network shutdown.
	/// </remarks>
