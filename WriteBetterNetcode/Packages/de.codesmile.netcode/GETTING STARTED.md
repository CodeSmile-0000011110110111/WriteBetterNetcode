# CodeSmile Packages - Getting Started

Orientation mainly for Asset Store customers since there is nothing under 'Assets' after installation because everything is in 'proper' npm packages.

Check the Menu for available functionality:
- Window => CodeSmile => ..

Run the Tests to confirm that everything is alright:
- Window => General => Test Runner -> (EditMode) -> select CodeSmile* -> (Run Selected)

Locate the Packages (README, Scripts, etc):
- Project view: `Packages/CodeSmile *`
- File system: `<path-to-project>/Packages/de.codesmile.*`

Some packages include a MANUAL.pdf file which is the offline version of the API reference.

You can find the latest versions and online documentation in the corresponding package repositories on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/CodeSmile-0000011110110111/) and on my Website [CodeSmile.de](https://codesmile.de/).
